:source-lang: clojure

Passes every item in `coll` to `f`, one at a time, and returns a single value.

== Parameters
`f`: a function with the signature `val, item -> val`
`val`: (optional) initial value to start the reduce with
`coll`: the collection to reduce


== Return value
any object


== Examples
[source]
----
(reduce + [1 2 3])
;; => 6
----


== Description

=== Basic intuition
The basic idea is to iterate through the `coll`, run each item through `f`, and
build up some kind of value. Although this sounds a little vague, this is
actually what a for loop is typically used for in imperative languages.

For example:
[source]
----
(reduce + 0 [1 2 3])
;; => 6
----


is roughly performing the following:
[source,python]
----
result = 0
for i in [1, 2, 3]:
  result += i
# result => 6
----


We can split out the logic inside the for-loop, and rewrite the loop like:
[source,python]
----
def add(some_result, item):
  return some_result + item

result = 0
for i in [1, 2, 3]:
  result = add(some_result, item)
# result => 6
----


We can take the for-loop and turn it into a re-usable function, "reduce":
[source,python]
----
def add(some_result, item):
  return some_result + item

def reduce(f, starting_val, coll):
  result = starting_val
  for i in coll:
    result = f(result, i)
  return result

reduce(add, 0, [1, 2, 3])
# => 6
----
