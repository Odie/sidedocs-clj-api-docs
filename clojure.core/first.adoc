:source-language: clojure
Returns the first item in the given collection.

== Parameters
`coll`: any clojure collection


== Return value
a value/object

or

nil::
* when the collection is nil or empty
* when the first item itself is nil


== Examples

(first [1 2 3])
;; => 1

(first [{:a :map} {:another :map}])
;; => {:a :map}


== Description

Some collections, such as hashmap and set, do not keep a strict order for the
values it holds. In such cases, `first` has no semantic meaning, but it will
retrieve *a* value stored in the collection.

[WARNING]
----
`first` will appear to work on small hashmaps while "breaking" on larger hashmaps.

On the JVM, small hashmaps (<= 8 elements) are implemented with the java class
`clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap`, which holds the hashmap entries in an array.
Calling `first` on such hashmaps may appear to give the desired result. However,
as soon as the hashmap grows beyond 8 elements, JVM clojure will convert the
collection to a `clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap` and "break" the behavior.
----

=== Working with Java
Any Java object that implements ISeq can be used with `first`.


== Exceptions
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: When `coll` isn't a collection
