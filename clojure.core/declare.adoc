:source-lang: clojure
Forward declare a var.

== Parameters
`names`: any number of vars to be declared


== Return value
nil


== Examples
[source]
----
(declare say-hi) <1>

(def greet
  [name]
  (say-hi)) <2>

(def say-hi
  []
  (println "hi"))
----
<1> Forward declare `say-hi`
<2> Reference `say-hi` before it is actually defined


== Description

Clojure performs compilation in a single pass. During compilation, if a
referenced var has not been defined, the compiler will throw an exception:

```
clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve symbol
```

To resolve this, use `declare` to declare the var before it is referenced. A
rationale of why this is done can be found here:
