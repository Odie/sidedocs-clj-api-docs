:source-lang: clojure

List comprehension. Collect the results of `body-expr` into a sequence with
bindings defined by `seq-exprs`.


== Parameters
`seq-exprs`: binding pairs in the shape of `[name sequence]`
`body-expr`: the expression to evaluate repeatedly


== Return value
sequence


== Examples
=== Iterating through a sequence
[source,clojure]

----
(for [i (range 1 5)] <1>
  i) <2>
;; => (1 2 3 4)
----
<1> create a binding named 'i' which will take on the value of the sequence `(range 5)` with each iteration
<2> collection the result of this expression into the returned sequence

=== Combinatorial binding behavior
[source,clojure]
----
(for [x (range 1 3)
      y (range 4 6)]
  [x y])
;; => ([1 4] [1 5] [2 4] [2 5])
----


== Description
The function is very similar to `clojure.core/doseq`.

FIXME! Add docs for :let, :while, and :when modifiers


== Exceptions
