:source-lang: clojure
Returns a new sorted hash set with supplied `keys`.

== Parameters
`keys`: the items that will go into the set


== Return value
a set


== Examples
[source]
----
(sorted-set :b :a :d :c :e :g :f)
;; => #{:a :b :c :d :e :f :g}
----


== Description

Note that Clojure provides no way to compare items of different types or types
that Clojure does not know how to compare.

[source]
----
(hash-set "123" :123)
;; => #{:123 "123"} <1>

(sorted-set "123" :123)
;; => java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to clojure.lang.Keyword <2>
----
<1> mixing items of different type in a hash-set is fine.
<2> mixing items of different type in a sorted-hash-set throws an exception because it isn't able to compare values of different types to establish an ordering.

To provide a custom comparator for the hash set, see `clojure.core/sorted-set-by`.
