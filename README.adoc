= What is this?

This repository holds alternative documentation (docstrings) for Clojure's core
library.

The docs are meant to be used in 2 ways:

. Presented by IDE to inform the programmer what a function does
. Exported to html for better presentation & searchability

= How do I use it?

See https://github.com/Odie/sidedocs-nrepl[sidedocs-nrepl].
It can be used inject these alternative docstrings into cider docstring requests.

= Documentation format
As much as it makes sense, the documentation tries to stick to the following format:

[source]
----
Short 1 line summary of what a function does with as few jargons as possible.

Important supplementary info goes here. Longer treatments on what the function
does should go in the `Description` section. The 1 line summary, `Parameters`,
and `Return values` sections should be kept close together visually and towards
the top.


== Parameters
list of parameters and their expected types


== Return value
list of return values and their expected types


== Examples
Short, idiomatic clojure example that shows the expected usage pattern.


== Description
Any lengthy description of the function goes here.


== Exceptions
List of possible exceptions that might be thrown and when they will be thrown.


== See Also
Links to related functions.
We might want to add some additional preprocessing to automatically create links here.


== Further Reading
Links to other official & unofficial documentation
