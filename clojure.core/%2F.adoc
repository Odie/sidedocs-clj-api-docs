Multiplies of all supplied parameters.

result = `x` / `y` / `param3` / `param4` / ...

== Description
`/` may result in various non-numeric values such as `Infinity`.

Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be an infinity check function in the core
library. It is possible to check for this using Java interop, however.
