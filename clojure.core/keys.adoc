:source-lang: clojure
Returns a sequence of all keys in `map`.

== Parameters
`map`: a hash-map


== Return value
Sequence of all keys of `map`


== Examples
[source]
----
(keys {:a 1 :b 2})
;; => (:a :b)


;; Keys are not guaranteed to be a particular order

(keys {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3 :d 4 :e 5 :f 6 :g 7 :h 8 :i 9})
;; => (:e :g :c :h :b :d :f :i :a)
----


== Description
`keys` does simply retrieves the keys as stored by the underlying
implementation. This means that for a hash-map, which does not maintain a
particular order for the keys, `keys` will appear to return the keys in no
particular order.


== Exceptions
- `java.lang.ClassCastException`: when the given `map` is not a type of hash-map
